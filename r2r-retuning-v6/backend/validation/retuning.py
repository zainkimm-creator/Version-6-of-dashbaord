"""Section 4.2 retuning: campaign definition, cost function and gain search.

This is the Tier 2 side of Section 4 - it *runs* the optimizer rather than
re-reading published numbers. Paper values stay comparison-only; nothing here
reads them.

The campaign
------------
Six plants x ten drift scenarios = 60 combinations, under two identification
protocols. For each combination a digital twin is identified from a single
excitation record, five retuning strategies search for a PI gain pair, and the
resulting gains are scored on the true drifted plant.

Every constant below is sourced, because most of them are the kind that
silently change a result:

* **Plants** - main-text Table 2: P001, P049, P053, P158, P186, P189 (the five
  slow-transport plants plus the fast plant P189 as a documented worst case).
* **Drift scenarios** - Section 3.3 and the Fig. 4 source data: nine
  single-family legs D01-D09 plus the combined D10. Friction moves at +-30%
  only; the +-15% legs that exist in ``data/processed`` are not campaign cells.
* **Cost** - Eq. (12) with fixed scales 3 N / 20 % / 3 s and overshoot weight 2.
* **Step response** - supplement S1.1: retuning campaigns settle for 1 s, step
  every channel to +20% of its setpoint, and run 5 s episodes.
* **HGS budget** - supplement S8.1: ~2,805 twin evaluations as a coarse grid, a
  Latin-hypercube refinement, a fine grid and a five-evaluation BO refinement.
* **Protocols** - Table S9 / ledger campaigns 10 and 11.

Transfer rule
-------------
HGS hands the real-plant optimizer candidate gain **locations only**. The twin's
cost values are withheld, because seeding a real-plant surrogate with simulated
costs would bias it by exactly the sim-to-real gap the experiment is measuring
(main text 4.2). ``hgs_candidates`` therefore returns points, not scores.
