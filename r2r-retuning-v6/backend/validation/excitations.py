"""Tension-setpoint excitation profiles used by SysID validation studies.

Every profile is now reconstructed from `data/paper_reference/
excitation_schedules_v5.csv`, the edge-level schedule table that ships with the
paper (Supplementary Table S1). Nothing here transcribes step times by hand: a
schedule change in the paper package propagates by replacing that file.

The reconstruction was checked against the previous hand-written profiles and
reproduces all six group-A records bit-for-bit, and it additionally makes the
two campaign variants reachable, which transcription had missed:

- ``B_dual_channel`` ET1 is a **30 s** record, not 7 s. Group B is the grid the
  published velocity-noise (dual-channel) cells were run on, and ET1 is the one
  type whose record length differs between the groups.
- ``C_retuning_field_matched`` is the main-text section 4 protocol: E_Toggle,
  settle 1 s, 16 s record, edges at 1/6/11 s.
